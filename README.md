# Crowdfunding_ETL
Nick and I collaborated to create the Category DataFrame,Subcategory DataFrame,Campaign DataFrame,Contacts DataFrame, and the Crowdfunding Database that 
are the results of creating the ETL pipeline that we were given instruction to create for this project. We each contributed to different dataframes and to the final database by transforming the data that we extracted, transforming it according to specific instructions, and then loading it into Postgres as a new database.
